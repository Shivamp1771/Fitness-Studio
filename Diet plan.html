            <h3>How to improve your BMI level</h3>
         <br>
    <p>When you go for a physical, your doctor will plug your height and weight into a simple formula to estimate your body fat. Body mass index is one of several measurements used to detect overweight and obesity. If your BMI exceeds 24.9, your physician will likely talk to you about healthy weight loss options. While BMI is a fairly reliable indicator of body fatness.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>Use a food diary to track your eating habits for several weeks. Write down everything you eat and drink, the time and your emotional state.</p></li>
          <li><p>Review the food journal and assess your eating habits. Once you are able to identify trends in your eating habits, you'll know where to make changes to cut calories and lower your BMI.</p></li>
          <li><p>Look for simple ways to cut calories.</p></li>
          <li><p>Follow a realistic diet plan that includes all of the food groups and allows room for the occasional indulgence.</p></li>
          <li><p>Work with a professional trainer to devise a fitness plan that fits your lifestyle. If you've never worked out before, exercise may seem overwhelming. A trainer will help you to build strength and endurance over time.</p></li>
          <li><p>Incorporate fitness into your everyday activities. Although scheduled time for exercise is important, you can also burn calories without going near the gym. Park on the far side of the lot so you'll have to walk farther, take the stairs instead of the elevator and do a few pushups in between tasks at work.</p></li>
